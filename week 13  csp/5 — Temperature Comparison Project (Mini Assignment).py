# Objective:
# Apply comparison and logical operators to a real-world problem.
# A real world example of a comparison and longical operation in the real-wolrd otday, would be temperture and weather

Weather = "rainy"
Temp = "13" 

if Weather == "rainy" and Temp < 15: 
    print ("Wear a coat and make sure to bring an umbrella")
elif Weather == "sunny" and Temp > 30:
    print("Wear something cool and drink some water")
elif Weather == "cloudy" or Temp < 10 :
    print("Weather is a bit chilly may have to wear a coat")
else :
    print ("Well, the weater seems fine so just have fun ouside!!!")

# Scenario:
# Write a program that:

# Asks the user for today’s temperature.

# Prints whether it’s cold, warm, or hot using comparison operators.

# If the temperature is out of range (below -10 or above 110), display “Extreme temperature warning!”
